# Face-Mask-Detection
Business Problem:


In this new era where we experiencing a pandemic and people all around are advised to wear masks, some people are not used to it and are avoiding to wear masks. 
The motivation behind this projects is that if we can take help of AI to detect people wearing or not wearing masks in public places, it would be helpful to increase our safety. 


Problem Statement:


The task here is to predict people wearing masks or not wearing them, given an image or a video. 
It is an object detection and classification problem with 2 different classes(Mask and Without Mask).
There are numerous methods for Object Detection but, for this I have decided to use TensorFlow,Keras and OpenCV as they are simple fast and one of the most accurate method out there.

Data:


The Dataset consist of a folder of pictures with mask and another folder of pictures without mask.
Dataset is downloaded from kaggle
